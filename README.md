# chip8-go
My own implementation of the [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8). Written in Go.

## Description
This Go program will make use of [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go) for handling the graphics and keyboard interruptions. Sound will come at a later stage.

## References
I am using [this](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) document as a technical reference.
